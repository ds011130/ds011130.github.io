<p>The shortest path problem is one of great importance to modern day daily life. The Shortest path problem is the method through which you attempt to get from one node to another node while traveling the least amount of distance. One of the biggest and easily seen examples of the shortest path problem is commercial airplanes. In order to maximize profits you want to get the planes to their destinations as quickly as possible in order to reduce fuel costs.</p>
<p>Another great example of the shortest path problem is the making of cars, this would be a directed network as the resources in the network always flow in one direction. First you start with the natural resources that are taken from the earth, then they are moved to where they are processed and from there they go to where they will be made into the cars. Of course I simplified a bit in reality there are a lot more nodes inbetween getting the materials from the earth and getting to the finished result. Optimizing this to get the shortest path allows for higher profit margins which makes it highly sought after.</p>
<p>The next recommended node would be the art gallery, however in this case since this part is directed visitors can only flow in one direction towards the next node which happens to be the art gallery problem node, see you there!</p>
