<p>This website was designed to be similar to a network graph in which nodes (pages) would contain the information regarding graph/network theory and they would be connected by lines, in this case links, to each other. The map to the network can be found at the bottom of every page in the event that you get lost.</p>
<p>This node is the center node, it is where all visitors will originate from as such it will have the largest amount of hits. The farther out a node is, in other words the more links that are required to get from the main page to it, the less visitors it will have.</p>
<p>There is no "correct" path to traverse this website, however I would highly recommend taking the following path in order to not miss any information, first go to graph theory then from there to network theory, after that follow the seven bridges path until you return to the home page, then being able to see the uses of graph/network theory in biology, social networking, and weblink analysis.</p>
