<p>In mathematics graph theory is the study of graphs. A graph is made up of vertices, nodes, or points which are connected by edges, arcs, or lines. A graph may be undirected meaning that there is no distinction between the 2 nodes associated with a line, on this website some lines are directed such as the seven bridgs path which means that they only flow in one direction, others are undirected meaning that you can go from the main page to graph theory and you can also go from graph theory to main page without any diffrence.</p>
<p>Graphs can be used to represent networks of communication, data organization, computational devices, and the flow of computation. In graph theory things are a lot more concrete for example the amount of units in the network remains constant or flows out or in a constant speed while in network theory it is more complex.</p>
<p>The next recommended node that you should visit is the network theory node which you can get to from the main page</p>s
