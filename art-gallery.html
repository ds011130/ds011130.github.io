<p>The Art-Gallery problem is one of less practical use compared to the shortest-path problem, however it is not without its use. The art-gallery problem gives you a layout of an art gallery and asks you what the minimum amount of gaurds, or cameras are necessary to maintain visibilty of all the paintings. It is a problem mainly dealing with computational geometry. In 2-dimensions one can devise an algorithm that would solve it, however when one considers the 3rd demension it becomes exponentially harder to calculate the solution.</p>
<p>Now that we have covered graph/network theory, you can visit the uses in the 3 uses pages, the flow there is a lot more free you can visit any of the three from any of the three.</p>
