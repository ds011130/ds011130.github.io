<p>Another important use of Graph/Network theory is its use in weblink analyis which in my opinion is by far the most intresting. In network theory, weblink analysis is a data-analysis technique used to evaluate relationships (connections) between nodes. In fact the map you see at the bottom of all these pages is a weblink analysis map.</p>
<p>Among its many uses webink analysis has been used for investigation of criminal activity (fraud detection, counterterrorism, and intelligence), computer security analysis, search engine optimization, and market research. Weblink analysis was first used before the internet was invented in 1975 in order to optimize the manner with which data was being transfered locally by domain experts.</p>
<p>Weblink analysis is used by many goverment agencies such as the FBI which uses it to not only analyze fraud attempts, but also to track violent crime. One of the intresting things is that weblink analysis suffers from information overload, in which the amount of information put onto the world wide web every second vastly outnumbers the computing power used to try and track all the new information. Now search engines such as google.com do not even attempt to understand the content that websites contain, they mearly index it and move onto the next one.</p>
