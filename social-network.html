<p>Social network analysis examines the structure of relationships between nodes, in most cases humans however they can be groups, organizations, nation states, web sites, or scholarly publications. Graph/Network Theory has been used in social networking since the 1970's where it was first developed under sociology.Amongst many other applications, social network analysis has been used to understand the diffusion of innovations, news and rumors. More recently it has been used in military intelligence, for uncovering insurgent networks of both hierarchical and leaderless nature.</p>
<p>An intresting note is that when studying the spread of information the resource put into the node multiplies without outside help, for example an event that happens to 10 people is spread over social media and then it becomes known to 100 people who in turn spread it to 1000's of people rapidly multipling the amount of knowledge in the network.</p>
