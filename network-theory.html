<p>Network theory has heavy uses in computer science, social networking, biology, and weblink analysis which is a subset of computer science. The terminology for Network theory is the same for Graph theory with one exception, this exception is spread. Spread what the network carries, it may be information, resources, or in the case of this website it is visitors.</p>
<p>Network theory encompasses many things such as network optimization, and interdependent networks which is what most of the networks we will look at fall under. Things that may appear simple from one angle such as the economics of a small country become very complicated when you see how a crisis on a node (another country) on the other side of the world affects it.</p>
<p>Now that we have talked about the terminology the next recommended node would be the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg Problem which is widly considered to be the first true proof in the theory of networks.</p>
